# Cargo configuration for CFS

# For iOS simulator builds, we need to help cmake find things
# Note: Metal is auto-detected and we can't easily disable it via env vars
# The simulator doesn't support Metal residency sets - use real device for AI features

[env]
# These will be picked up by the llama-cpp-sys-2 build.rs
# Unfortunately, cmake auto-detects Metal and the Rust crate doesn't expose a disable option
